# Shape Generator

## Description
In this challenge I used inquirer to prompt the user with questions to create an SVG logo. I used class constructors to assign values to each shape object. Once the user answers all the prompts the new Logo will be created in the ./output directory. I also wrote tests for my code to be sure my class constructors were working properly.

## Usage
The user can answer pre-determined questions to generate an SVG logo.
